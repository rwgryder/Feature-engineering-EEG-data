# Feature-engineering-EEG-data

A tree-based Genetic Program (an Evolution Algorithm) is used to search for optimal engineered features consisting of algebraic expressions on original features in a data prediction setting. This work used the gplearn Python package. (https://gplearn.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) However, we do make an original adjustment to the optimization procedure: a mutual information fitness metric to evaluate the engineered feature sets, and a local search step to make the algorithm a hybrid/memetic search procedure. This novel feature engineering method is applied to an EEG data set and shows promising results in the form of increased accuracy on test data. For more background information, see the PDF document to be published soon.
